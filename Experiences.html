        <h1>Sayoni Mitra</h1>
     
	   <p>Zaariya started as the social service “club” in my college NISER, whose main aim was to promote social awareness and responsibility in our college students. It was the brain child of one of our seniors, Surya Bhaiya and eventually, many student volunteers signed up for it. One of the first activities we performed was the cleanliness drive in our IOP campus.</p>
	   <p>However, a major turning point (atleast for me) was when we started educating the kids living on the opposite side of the road in the slums. Initially, we would play with the kids and enquire about how far they have studied, whether they ever went to school, their 		dreams and aspirations and their family situation. All of them had varied life experiences. There were many of them who had been studying in “schools” but hardly knew the alphabets or numbers! There were others too, who had been forced to drop out of school due to lack of money and pressure from family members.</p>
	   <p>But they had one thing in common, they wanted to study. I wouldn’t say, that they value “education” in the way we do. They are kids who are mostly in the age-group 5-10, who spend their time working, playing and surviving in far harsher conditions than I have been brought up in, of course they cannot understand supreme importance of education that one realises with age. However, they somehow do know that “education” will help them achieve their dreams.</p>
	   <p>Finally, we divided all the kids amongst the volunteers so that we could focus on each child properly based on his/her needs. Blessy and I were put in charge of Sangeeta, Reshma and Sandhya Reshma.</p>
	   <p>Sandhya Reshma is the youngest (only 3 years old) and recently, we were successful in admitting her to Bal Sainik School (Nursery). It is lucky that she is so little, she can receive structured education without any delay.</p>
	   <p>Sangeeta and Reshma are both very contrasting and alike at the same time. Though they both belong to the same age group (8-9), Reshma has been lucky enough to go to school. However, we realised, even though she is supposed to be studying in 6th standard, she’s unable to write the alphabets properly! It highlights the apathetic condition of (a few) government schools. On the other hand, Sangeeta had dropped school because of her mother’s severe illness, because she’s the youngest one (the others are all married, save one) in the family, and somebody had to take care of the household.</p>
	   <p>The similarity is, both of them are extremely bright students. I did not expect them to learn the alphabets so fast, and they both 	seem to have a lot of potential. Sangeeta got admitted to the RRL school recently, just like many of the kids who are a part of Zaariya. An enormous thanks to the very helpful government officials, who commended the NISER students’ efforts, and were cooperative enough to take in these kids.</p>
	   <p>I would say my personal experience has been a very emotional one. A nostalgic one. I never comprehended that teaching kids is that 	tough, that drilling the basics (alphabets or numbers) is a Herculean task that requires truck-loads of patience. By this journey, I have realised that my parents and kindergarten teachers (infact, the same applies for everyone) who carried this out deserve a huge round of applause! There is a certain wonderful satisfaction that one derives from teaching, and I think I can relate to my parents, teachers and professors better.</p>
	   <p>I hope Zaariya is successful in expanding further. There are so many kids to be taught!</p>

	   <p>Zaariya – a means to serve the society, to reach out to the needy and the underprivileged is the brainchild of several like-minded 	NISERites who got together with the aim of bringing about a difference in the world we live in. Spanning over a few weeks there were several activities organized by Zaariya club members.</p>
	   <p>I remember how a few weeks back the small footpath that led from the main building to the mess was dumped with litter. Every time I crossed that path I couldn’t help but notice plastic cups and wrappers lying all around. The lack of a requisite number of dustbins at appropriate places was indeed a matter of concern not only for me but for many other fellow NISERites. It was then that Zaariya volunteers decided to address this issue and undertook the “Dustbin initiative”. It was a unique experience collecting empty cans, cleaning them, painting them, writing the initials of Zaariya on each newly made dustbin. Our hard work finally paid off when this initiative was greeted with a warm response from NISERites as well as Institute of Physics (IOP) authorities. What had seemed to be a big challenge initially was progressing well. The dustbins had been placed at several locations throughout the campus; they were being used at least. Within a few weeks the litter around the campus had reduced; students were happy for not having to carry used wrappers with them all the way from the mess to the main building looking for a dustbin. Very soon IOP authorities took measures to install larger trash bins at all those locations where Zaariya had set up dustbins. It was indeed a great achievement to have made the authorities realize the gravity of the situation and create a general awareness among everyone about maintaining a clean environment.</p>
	   <p>There’s nothing that feels better than coming together to help do good and spread happiness. I felt a sense of accomplishment when 	Zaariya started the drive for collection of clothes for the needy and the way people responded to it and contributed generously. The smile on the faces of the kids in the orphanage made me realize that even a small contribution from a single individual could bring joy 		in so many lives.</p>
	   <p>It’s heart-warming that Zaariya has become a means to usher in new initiatives to change our world for the better.</p>

	   <h1>Mahesh Gandikota</h1>
       <p>S.K. Shukriya had just left work in the canteen of a hospital. Due to the physical violence he had to face, he stopped going to work and school. Shukriya is very talkative, loves to cycle, involves in brawls and speaks only the truth.</p>
	   <p>The first day I met him, he enthusiastically narrated  several things about his life – the number of friends he has at home, his visit to the Nandankaanan zoo, how the nurses at the hospital (his last workplace) love him, how he avenges anyone who bullies him and so on.</p>
	   <p>To make a start, that day I showed him satellite pictures of Bhubaneswar -> Orissa -> India -> earth as seen from outer space. He seemed captivated. I also demonstrated an aspect of the relationship of the sun and the earth – `Jab yahan subah hoga, tab America mein raat hoga’, I said. `To jab waha din hoga, yaha raat hoga?’ he asked. I was happy that he was observing a new concept sincerely.</p>
	   <p>We met around 15 times more. We started with learning English alphabets and numbers. He surprised me by showing familiarity with the alphabets and knowing the Hindi representation of numbers till 30. He pressed the pencil hard onto the lines of a four-line notebook as he wrote `A’. I asked him to practice writing it in home. The next time we met, he had densely filled the page with `A’s.</p>
	   <p>Without fail, he used to emboss the number 786 (a holy number of Muslims) on the coverpage of his khaata s. `Yeh hamara bhagwan hain’ he used to say. I used to discuss with Preeti (she interacts with the kids – Sanu and Rabi) about his progress and her experience helped. Shukriya practiced writing the English alphabet but he did not yet master the recognition of the sound corresponding to each letter. He learnt the alphabet song (till `t’). He wrote numbers from 1-100 in the notebook with small blue boxes (We used to call it the ‘dabba-wala khata‘)  and was getting a grip on adding numbers. We also discussed several concepts like: the solar system, water cycle, photosynthesis and the food chain. In last few sessions, we enjoyed colouring pictures too. These were some of the nice instances in the sessions:</p>

	   <ol><li> He voluntarily recited the alphabet song as soon as we met after our breaks of 2 days.</li>
	   <li>Almost every time, he completed the homework assigned to him (sometimes he did more than I asked).</li>
	   <li>He remembered our discussion on photosynthesis – he once referred to it during a discussion we were having on some other issue!</li></ol>
	
	   <p>Shukriya and his family were eager to send him to the school in Paralakhemundi where his brother Tehsin Khan is studying. Thus, we 		could take the next step of sending Shukriya to have a more structured learning at this primary school. He now lives there, along with his brother, about 300 kilometers away from Bhubaneswar. They both informally attend classes, tend to vegetable gardens in the school and play with a horse which has strayed into the campus. Tehsin named her Rani.</p>
	   <p>When Shukriya narrated me his visit to the Nandankaanan zoo, he told that the driver of the safari jeep did not allow him and his friend to sit in it. He said it as if that had no emotional impact on him. I realized how much he was used to being treated like that. 	Schooling is a long journey and  though he is now in school, nothing is certain. I hope he gets well educated and suitably employed.  	Nandankaanan zoo will still be around. Maybe then, he can enjoy a ride in the safari jeep.</p>

	   <h1>Preeti Sahu</h1>
       <p>Like many of us, I too was living the life of a “passive” supporter of child education, social equality, etc.. At home, I had silently obeyed my mother when she instructed me to hand the sweeper his/ her money carefully enough so that I don’t happen to touch him/her(as they are of low caste).. Even after coming to NISER, I could feel those invisible walls between those in the slum (just outside 		NISER) and us. They were so many slum kids playing out there and yet not a single one ever dashed into us while playing! This distance was so religiously maintained that I wondered if untouchability was ever removed from our society!</p>
	   <p>Now when I walk through the same lanes, adjacent to the slum, the girls whom I taught singing, coming rushing to me and plant a kiss lovingly on my cheek and forehead. I feel so human then.. I feel so light as those invisible chains, that had restrained my mind for so long, receded away.</p>
	   <p>Zaariya helped me fulfill two of my most precious childhood dreams .. teaching and singing. I feel so proud when those girls sing “Vande Utkal Janani” so merrily with me.</p>
	   <p>Being a volunteer adds some responsibility to the otherwise chaotic life of a college student. You stop indulging yourself, being lazy and an efficient procrastinator ; because now a child’s future is at stake and your role IS pivotal!</p>
	   <p>This experience changed my ignorant attitude toward the question- “Why do so many of these slum children don’t study ?” I came across a variety of eye-opening situations. We soon realized that each of these diverse and sophisticated cases has to be dealt in a customized way. In the process, it made me a lot more patient and persistent in our endeavors.</p>
	   <p>Aptly put by Surya- Although I am supposed to play the role of a teacher, it was these children who taught us to zoom out and acknowledge how minuscule are the problems that seems so onerous in our own lives! The children start becoming your daily doze of vivacity.</p>
	   <p>Tehasin- He was our first ‘Teacher’… He taught us the way to lead a “Khan’s life”. His gregariousness had cast a spell on many of us. It all started the day he gave a tiny bottle of ittar(a natural perfume oil used by many Muslim men and women) to Srijit for safekeeping… and metaphorically, within no time this fragrance found its way to everybody’s heart! There were so many Niserites who loved him dearly and taught him.</p>
	   <p>After teaching him, we got to know about his aptitude for maths. Even after endless trips to different schools under the scorching 	sun, we couldn’t find him an apt school within Bhubaneshwar then.</p>
	   <p>After sending him to Parlekhamundi, now he’s getting a formal education along with his younger brother. His daily phone calls are like stress-busters…Those trivial spellings of primer words, that he spells out to me each day are like music to my ears. I feel content to see him in a safe and nurturing environment- giggling, playing, learning and living his lost childhood again.</p>
	   <p>Rabi- His gleaming eyes were notably different from other children of his age.. It resembled the lustre of a metal subjected to extreme conditions for purification.. His father had died some years back leaving his second wife(and Rabi’s mother) completely unattended even after being paralyzed and mentally challenged.</p>
	   <p>I was very fortunate to get the opportunity to teach this little angel. He is a boy of twelve working in a restaurant called ‘Jagannath’ near Omfed parlour. The owner’s elder son, Gyan, himself walked to me to ask me to teach this child. I was glad but had to bargain with him to have a complete hour of class(he insisted on a half an hour class due to excessive work-load on the kid!). Our sessions where so warm that I can barely wait to pick him up each day. He just loved ‘learning’. Even on badminton court his steep learning curve astonished us- keen observation of strategies and immediate execution!</p>
	   <p>He had an aptitude for both maths and language. But immediately after we disclosed our plan to the shopkeepers, they turned hostile to us. They had cooked up excuses for each day to not send him for the sessions. We started enquiring about the information we had got from the owner, regarding his family conditions, from Rabi’s relatives. Our only contact was with the step-sister. They all seemed to pity the fate of this nearly orphaned child but surprisingly, no one wanted him to study! Gyan, who had bragged a lot about his philanthropy in giving Rabi a ‘life’, soon got utterly pissed off when we started nagging them repeatedly about Rabi’s schooling. The next protagonist- younger son of the owner, used procrastination as his weapon to keep us away. By now, it was quite clear that it was bare monetary benefits that was driving all this rather than philanthropy! They claimed they need Rabi to work and earn to pay back his own sister’s dowry ( worth Rs 40,000 only) in addition to the monthly allowance of Rs 3000 per month, that they send to Rabi’s paralyzed mother via his step-sister! The shop-keepers turned a blind eye to all our inquiries regarding Rabi’s mother. We were compelled to resort to his relatives.</p>
	   <p>In the process we gradually came across the third protagonist, the husband of his step-sister, who disclosed how dearly they wanted Rabi to work to pay back another 50,000 bucks that he had to spend in their marriage on behalf of his step-sister! He had also planned to redeem his money by making Rabi work in a Saloon! Amidst all these ridiculous plans, we found Rabi gone with his relatives without intimating us. Upon inquiring how did they let him go without intimating us, the owners blamed us for nagging so much; as that made the relatives take the kid with them forever. But fortunately, Rabi returned in 4–5 days. We immediately called the step brother-in-law to ask the duration for which Rabi would be working at the restaurant. He told us that he had come there for merely two days to settle his account with the owner. That day, we gave a last attempt trying to persuade the shopkeepers that it’s them who can help the kid study; but all in vain. We decided to take a legal action against them and reported the police the very same evening.</p>
	   <p>The next morning, Rabi was evacuated from the restaurant with the help of police and NGO Ruchika’s workers. With no special interrogation, her sister admitted that the kid’s work was seen as the means to pay for the 1 lakh rupees that her husband demanded as dowry. I just hope Rabi overcomes the numerous scars his past life has left him with and regains his lost childhood.</p>

	   <h1>Suryanarayan Balasubramanian</h1>
       <p>A talkative kid called Tehasin Khan used to work in our college mess. The disconcerting experience of seeing this child clean our tables and mop the mess floor made him the subject of most of our conversations. His cheerfulness made us think twice about all the hurdles that we had assumed insurmountable. We were surprised to see how curious he was to learn more inspite of his present situation. In just a few weeks he got acquainted with most of the college community for this purpose. He soon had people demanding his presence in order to teach him odiya and mathematics. His desire to learn grew but none knew how best to help him in the long run. He had willingly dropped out of government school and we sympathized with his decision considering how dysfunctional government schools were.</p>
	   <p>One day while he was learning math with me, he told that he is about to quit his job in order to find another one with a better pay so that he could save enough to go back to school. That was when we (Srijit and me) decided to take on the challenge of getting him back to school.</p>
	   <p>Tehasin belongs to a family in which almost everybody is a daily wage laborer. Even if we were to send him home and admit him to a 	nearby school, he would soon drop out of school and start working again elsewhere. In fact, soon after he left his job in the mess, he joined some other place to work even though we had instructed him to prepare for the school we hoped to find. Another problem is that he is now too old to be considered for admission to most elementary schools. Going by his actual age (which is 13–14), he should have been in class 7th, but even the learning curve of a class 4 curriculum would have been too steep for him.</p>
	   <p>I was under the impression that the most difficult thing was to acquire necessary funds to send him to a good quality school. However the real challenge was not that. In 3 months we were able to find just one private school which was willing to discuss the terms of his admission. We were forced to reject their offer as they required him to learn 4 languages in the period of 3 months for admission in his age appropriate class. After many a desperate emails later, I finally found a school 300 km from Bhubaneswar that seemed ideal for his education as it recognized his needs and had teachers enthusiastic enough to educate him. Dhanadha Mishra (he is associated with SPIC-MACAY and stays in touch with NISER’s Drama & Music Club), the founder of this school helped us get him admission in Shaala Public School. Tehasin studies there now. He talks to me daily about the exotic birds that visit the school campus, the vegetables that his caretaker grows in the school plot and his activities in school. His progress in just 2 months of schooling has been astounding.</p>
	   <p>This experience humbled me to the plight of all the out of school children that I saw living in the slums facing my institute for the past 4 years. I realized how ostracized this community felt. I understood why most children seemed to be out of school. For some, their parents can’t afford the fees of other private schools, or can’t afford the opportunity costs of not having their children working for the family purse. So, they either don’t send them to school at all or must send them to a public school, where they will likely feel abandoned.</p>
	   <p>In order to experience the gravity of the situation I went to the slums for enquiry with our college sweeper as my guide. Sure enough, children and their parents thronged around me debunking the myth of their disinterest towards education. Thus a NISER social outreach club – Zaariya took birth. Till now 53 volunteers have participated from NISER in ‘get-to-know’ sessions with 50 underprivileged children over the past three weeks. In these sessions, each volunteer spends atleast 3 hours with the kids assigned under him/her every week. The objective is to establish a genuine relationship with these children and in the long run — get them admitted to schools. The volunteers would continue their support towards the children’s day-to-day school activities to ensure they are well accommodated.</p>
	   <p>This whole initiative began because of the extensive financial support that we received from faculty, students, alumni and friends. The boarding school where Tehasin is placed is eager to admit more such children. We plan to provide targeted vouchers to the parents of the kids who are young (below 8) and directly negotiate with the schools to get the others admitted.</p>
	   <p>The hopeless gaze that I wore the past 4 years when I looked at the slum that we passed by several times a day has transformed into one filled with expectations. The slum children who were anything but visible relate to beautiful memories now.</p>

	   <p>To be compassionate is a rare virtue in this world! Those who are gifted with the capacity to understand the agonies of the fellow 	beings is indeed a blessed class. Our students at NISER have given an expression of their compassionate minds by forming an organization named “Zaariya” to serve as a medium for translating their concern and feeling for their fellow beings.</p>
	   <p>The success of rehabilitating Master Tehsin Khan back to schooling after removing him from the clutches of child labour gave them the confidence to undertake such noble acts at a larger scale. The activists of Zaariya have now started teaching children from the nearby slum area who have not been fortunate to be at the schools. They already have identified 39 children of ages between 3 and 10 and are now being prepared to be sent to schools. This magnificent effort comes from them with some financial support from varied people including NISER faculty. A part of their scholarships is spared too to meet some of the expenses. As soon as these children are ready, they are to be enrolled in some good schools to continue with their education, as in the case of Master Tehsin.</p>
	   <p>The photographs show Zaariya activists helping the children to learn. Every evening they are on the lawns of the Institute of Physics to learn for about an hour and half assisted by the volunteers, to be followed by half an hour of playing with their mentors. The happiness on the faces of these children is beyond description, to be seen to be believed.</p>
	   <p>Zaariya has taken off to a wonderful start with a magnificent project. This social service organization of the NISER students is here to stay and flourish in the years to come. It is such compassionate minds and humane acts which give us lot of hope and faith in the future of mankind.</p>
       <p>‘Sahasrakoti Pranams’ to you my dear children. Your endeavour will bear fruit by lighting the lamp of love and compassion in the lives of thousands in the years to come.</p>
