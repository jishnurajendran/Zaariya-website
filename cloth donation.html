    <h1>Problem</h1>
    <p>Many of our volunteers had observed that the kids from the nearby slum don’t have proper clothes or shoes to wear. Most of them wore the same dress over the weeks. The state of their apparel wasn’t great either. Some were torn, some were too old to be used again. Also it bothered us when we saw people forced to sleep bare-bodied during cold winter nights. When we asked them the reason they told they don’t earn enough to be able to afford for more than two pairs of clothes. Hence Zaariya decided to address this issue.</p>

    <h1>Project Outline</h1>
    <p>Identification of people with limited financial resources and with no access to proper clothing; Establishment of an efficient channel to reach out to these people and provide them clothes.</p>
    <hr>
    <h1>Project Accomplishments</h1>
    <p> Many families in the slum opposite to IOP Campus, Bhubaneswar were given clothes; kids were also given new clothes; beggars sitting near different temples were also identified and were given clothes. Around 70 packets of clothes were distributed in the entire process.</p>
    <hr>
    <h1>Future plans</h1>
    <p>A second round of the collection drive shall be organised in August 2015. Zaariya shall also be collaborating with other NGOs who specifically work for this purpose and thus establish an efficient channel through which clothes collected in future collection drives can be distributed to the needy.</p>
