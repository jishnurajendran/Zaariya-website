    <h1>Concern</h1>
    <p>Every year our nation requires about 4 crore units of blood out of which only a meagre 40 lakh units of blood are available. Almost every two seconds, someone needs blood. Unfortunately blood can’t be manufactured. It can only come from generous donors. Many healthy and educated 
    individuals however don’t come forward to volunteer for this noble cause because of several misconceptions regarding blood donation.</p>

    <p>Organisation of a blood donation campaign in the institute premises to create awareness among the students, faculties as well as staff and other campus residents about blood donation; provisions for an opportunity for voluntary donors to come forward and join us in the noble cause by donating blood.</p>
